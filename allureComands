Dot env 
-----------------
As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv:

require('dotenv').config()
console.log(process.env) // remove this after you've confirmed it is working

.. or using ES6?

import * as dotenv from 'dotenv' // see https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#how-do-i-use-dotenv-with-import
dotenv.config()
import express from 'express'
